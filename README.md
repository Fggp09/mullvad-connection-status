## Overview

This application provides a visual indicator for your Mullvad VPN connection status when running the VPN on a gateway device. It sits quietly in your system tray, changing colors based on your connection state, and displays detailed connection information when needed.

## Features

- **System Tray Integration** - Unobtrusive tray icon that changes color based on VPN status (green for connected, red for disconnected)
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Checks VPN connection status every 15 seconds
- **Connection Details** - View your current IP address, server location, hostname, and protocol type
- **Desktop Notifications** - Optional alerts when your VPN connection state changes
- **Minimal Resource Usage** - Approximately 30-40 MB RAM usage thanks to Tauri's efficient architecture
- **Fast Startup** - Launches in under half a second

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Rust (Tauri v2 framework)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, npm
- **APIs**: Mullvad public API (am.i.mullvad.net)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. Node.js (version 18 or later)

**Download and Install:**
- Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- Download the LTS version for Windows
- Run the installer and follow the prompts
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```

### 2. Rust (latest stable version)

**Install using rustup:**
- Visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- Download and run `rustup-init.exe`
- Follow the installation prompts (use default options)
- **Important:** Restart your terminal after installation
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  rustc --version
  cargo --version
  ```

**Alternative using winget:**
```bash
winget install Rustlang.Rustup
```

### 3. Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows - Required)

**This is critical for Rust compilation on Windows. Without it, you'll get `link.exe` not found errors.**

**Option A: Visual Studio Build Tools (Recommended)**
1. Download from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
2. Scroll to "Tools for Visual Studio"
3. Download **Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022**
4. Run the installer
5. Select **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
6. Ensure these components are checked:
   - MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
   - Windows 11 SDK (or Windows 10 SDK)
   - C++ CMake tools for Windows
7. Click Install (10-20 minutes installation time)
8. **Restart your terminal** after installation

**Option B: Using winget**
```bash
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --override "--wait --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools --includeRecommended"
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
where link.exe
```
This should show a path like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\...`

### 4. WebView2 Runtime

**Usually pre-installed on Windows 11**, but if needed:
- Download from [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- Install the Evergreen Standalone Installer

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mullvad-connection-status
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify prerequisites** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   node --version   # Should show v18.x or higher
   cargo --version  # Should show cargo 1.x.x
   where link.exe   # Should show Visual Studio path
   ```

That's it! You're ready to develop.

## Development

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server and launch the Tauri application window.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

The compiled executable will be located in:
```
src-tauri/target/release/mullvad-connection-status.exe
```

An installer will also be generated in:
```
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

## Configuration

### Changing the Polling Interval

By default, the application checks VPN status every 15 seconds. To modify this:

1. Open `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
2. Find line 84 (approximately)
3. Change the duration value:
   ```rust
   let mut poll_interval = interval(Duration::from_secs(15)); // Change 15 to your preferred interval
   ```

### Customizing Icons

The application includes icons in the `src-tauri/icons/` directory using Mullvad's official brand colors:

- `icon.png` - Default tray icon (Mullvad blue #294d73)
- `icon-connected.png` - Shown when VPN is connected (green #44ad4d)
- `icon-disconnected.png` - Shown when VPN is disconnected (red #e34039)

All required icon formats (32x32, 128x128, ICO, ICNS) are included and ready for use. The shield and lock design represents VPN security and protection.

## Windows Auto-Start Setup

To launch the application automatically when Windows starts:

### Method 1: Startup Folder (Recommended)

1. Build the application using `npm run tauri build`
2. Navigate to the executable location: `src-tauri/target/release/`
3. Right-click on `mullvad-connection-status.exe` and select "Create shortcut"
4. Press `Win + R` and type `shell:startup`, then press Enter
5. Move the shortcut into the Startup folder that opens

### Method 2: Windows Registry (Advanced)

1. Press `Win + R` and type `regedit`, then press Enter
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
3. Create a new String Value:
   - Name: `MullvadConnectionStatus`
   - Value: `"C:\full\path\to\mullvad-connection-status.exe"`
4. Restart your computer to test

## How It Works

The application queries Mullvad's public API endpoint (`https://am.i.mullvad.net/json`) to determine if your internet traffic is routing through a Mullvad VPN server. The API returns information including:

- Whether you're connected to a Mullvad server
- Your current public IP address
- The geographic location of the VPN server
- The server hostname
- The connection protocol (WireGuard or OpenVPN)

This information is displayed in a clean, minimal interface accessible by clicking the tray icon.

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. Launch the application
2. The tray icon appears in your system tray (bottom-right of taskbar)
3. The icon color indicates your status:
   - Green = Connected to Mullvad VPN
   - Red = Not connected
4. Left-click the tray icon to show/hide the status window
5. Right-click the tray icon for the menu (Show/Quit options)

### Status Window

When you click the tray icon, a window appears showing:
- Connection status with a visual indicator
- Your current IP address
- Server location (city and country)
- Server hostname
- Connection protocol type

Click the close button or the tray icon again to hide the window. The application continues running in the background.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: `link.exe` not found

**Problem:** Rust compilation fails with "linker `link.exe` not found"

**Solution:**
1. Install Visual Studio Build Tools (see Prerequisites section above)
2. Make sure you selected the "Desktop development with C++" workload
3. **Restart your terminal** after installation
4. Verify with `where link.exe` - should show Visual Studio path
5. If still not working, try running from "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022"

### Error: `cargo` command not found

**Problem:** Rust is not installed or not in PATH

**Solution:**
1. Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
2. **Restart your terminal completely** (close and reopen)
3. Verify with `cargo --version`
4. If still not working, manually add to PATH: `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`

### Build Fails or Compilation Errors

**Try these steps in order:**

1. **Update Rust:**
   ```bash
   rustup update
   ```

2. **Clean the build cache:**
   ```bash
   cd src-tauri
   cargo clean
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Remove node_modules and reinstall:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

4. **Try building again:**
   ```bash
   npm run tauri build
   ```

### WebView2 Not Found

**Problem:** Application won't launch, missing WebView2

**Solution:**
Download and install WebView2 Runtime from [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/).

### Application Won't Start in Dev Mode

**Problem:** Port 1420 already in use

**Solution:**
1. Check if another instance is running (close it)
2. Or change the port in `vite.config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   server: {
     port: 1421, // Change to different port
   }
   ```

### Icons Don't Appear in System Tray

**Problem:** No tray icon visible

**Solution:**
1. Check that icon files exist in `src-tauri/icons/` (they should be in the repo)
2. Try rebuilding: `npm run tauri build`
3. On Windows 11, check system tray settings (some icons may be hidden)

### VPN Status Not Updating

**Problem:** Shows "Disconnected" even when VPN is active

**Solution:**
1. Verify internet connection is working
2. Test the API manually: visit `https://am.i.mullvad.net/json` in browser
3. Check firewall isn't blocking the application
4. Verify you're actually routing through Mullvad (check on gateway)

### First Build Takes Very Long

**This is normal.** The first Rust build compiles all dependencies and can take 5-10 minutes. Subsequent builds will be much faster (under 1 minute for small changes).
